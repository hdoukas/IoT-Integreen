Tool:
- convTimeInte.js: converts UNIX timestamps into cleartext dates, is appended to
  the curl commands: | ./convTimeInte.js
  Works eg. for "get-records" and "get-date-of-last-record".
  Attention: when the returned dataset is big, the JSON records get splitted
  up in more transmission chunks in which case the tool may fail.
