There are the following service object templates provided:
- meteoSO: .json + .id, intended for use with the InTeGreen Meteo frontend
- parkingSO: .json + .id, intended for use with the InTeGreen Parking frontend

Other stuff:
- SOgenerator.js: script which creates apposite SO for the specified InTeGreen
  frontend
- flows.json: Node-Red flow for ServIoTicy-InTeGreen integration, needs to be
  copied into the Node-Red directory and renamed to flows-<hostname>.json
- convTimeServ.js: converts UNIX timestamps into cleartext dates, is appended to
  the curl commands: | ./convTimeServ.js
  Works eg. for getting SO data (= updates).
  Attention: when the returned dataset is big, the JSON records get splitted
  up in more transmission chunks in which case the tool may fail. 

For more commands please look under ../arduinoTemp/cmds.txt!
